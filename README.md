# ITVDN_frontend-course

## ThriveTalk is latest project after the CSS Grid Course at ITVDN (Frontend Developer Course).

### I used semantic tags in html-layout, BEM for class names, CSS Grid for creating a template page, CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox for styling page sections, responsive images, media queries for creating responsive page variations, vendor prefixes for css-properties for cross-browser compatibility. 

### This project has a '7-in-1' architecture: all of the project's style files are included in main.css. 
### Also I used normalized.css to normalize CSS styles across different browsers.
